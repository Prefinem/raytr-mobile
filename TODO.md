# TODO

- Revisit needing ratingSchema (we could just use scoreName?)
- If keeping ratingSchema, rename to ratingMetric
- Home Page (UI)
- Category List Page
- Edit Item Page
- View Ratings
- Delete Ratings (swipe?)

## Next Features

- Add Page for a feed of Ratings
- Add Lists which allows Items to get added to them
- Profile page should show "Coming Soon"

## Fast Follow

- Undefined on add Item / add Rating
- Update "you don't have any text" - Click the appropriate buttons
- Home button navigates to home instead of all the way back
- Error handling for all saves and deletes

## Cleanup

- PropTypes for all components
